# Speech Recognition with LSTM and Bidirectional LSTM Networks

## Overview
This repository contains the final project for a Deep Learning course, focusing on speech recognition through LSTM and bidirectional LSTM networks. It showcases the process of classifying spoken digits using the AudioMNIST dataset, leveraging MFCCs for audio signal representation.

## Project Structure
- `Data Preprocessing`: Scripts and notebooks for transforming audio signals into MFCCs.
- `Model Training`: Code for training LSTM and bidirectional LSTM models.
- `Evaluation`: Notebooks and scripts for testing the models and analyzing their performance.
- `Report`: A detailed report (DL_Final_Project.pdf) explaining the methodology, results, and conclusions of the project.

## Getting Started
To replicate the project's findings or further explore the models:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries (PyTorch, TorchAudio, Matplotlib, SkLearn) installed.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebooks to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

## Results
The project achieved notable success in speech recognition:
- LSTM Model Accuracy: 99.55%
- Bidirectional LSTM Model Accuracy: 99.73%

For detailed results, including confusion matrices and accuracy graphs, refer to `DL_Final_Project.pdf`.

## Contributions
Contributions to improve or extend the project are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
